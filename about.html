    <h1 class="page-header">About me</h1>
    <p>I'm Moritz Schulze, a software developer based in Berlin.</p>
    <p>
      Before working in the software industry I studied mathematics at <a href="http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/">TU Darmstadt</a>. I already liked mathematics when I was in school and decided to continue with it. I specialized in Discrete Optimization and wrote my thesis about a modification of Branch & Bound for binary integer programs.

      After university I took a job in consulting. My company specialized on processes in the financial sector, but I worked in the data integration department of a bank for three years.

      Programming is not only my job but also my hobby. Check out the <a href="projects.html">projects section</a>!

      Apart from programming I'm a big music lover. I played an instrument since the beginning of preschool. Take a look at the <a href="music.html">music section</a> to find out more about that!

      I also like to do some sports regularly. Nothing fancy, just hitting some weights in the gym a few times the week.

      And of course I enjoy the live in Berlin - going out with friends, eating, concerts...
