Before working in the software industry I studied mathematics at
[TU Darmstadt](http://www.tu-darmstadt.de). I already
liked mathematics when I was in school and decided to continue with
it. I specialized in Discrete Optimization and wrote my thesis about
a modification of Branch & Bound for binary integer programs.

After university I took a job in consulting. My company specialized
on processes in the financial sector, but I worked in the data
integration department of a bank for three years.

Apart from programming I'm a big music lover. I played an instrument
since the beginning of preschool. Take a look at the [music section](/music)
to find out more about that!

And of course I enjoy the live in Berlin - going out with friends,
eating, concerts...
