# Music

I have been making music for a very long time now. Back then it was only the recorder.
But I quickly progressed to the clarinet and kept playing that for almost 18 years.
From 2005 - 2010 I was part of the [Jugend Musik Ensemble](http://www.jugend-musik-ensemble.de)
in Frankfurt, a really great small amateur orchestra. In Berlin, after a year of
doing almost nothing musically I started to play piano, teaching myself.

You can find some piano recordings on [my soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/moritz-schulze).

Of course I also listen to music a lot. My taste varies, depending on the year,
mood, daytime... Here's my [last.fm profile](http://www.last.fm/user/Ludwig_van)

I attend quite a lot concerts in Berlin - both classical and popular music.
