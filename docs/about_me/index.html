    <p>Before working in the software industry I studied mathematics at
<a href="http://www.tu-darmstadt.de">TU Darmstadt</a>. I already
liked mathematics when I was in school and decided to continue with
it. I specialized in Discrete Optimization and wrote my thesis about
a modification of Branch &amp; Bound for binary integer programs.</p>
<p>After university I took a job in consulting. My company specialized
on processes in the financial sector, but I worked in the data
integration department of a bank for three years.</p>
<p>Apart from programming I&rsquo;m a big music lover. I played an instrument
since the beginning of preschool. Take a look at the <a href="/music">music section</a>
to find out more about that!</p>
<p>And of course I enjoy the live in Berlin - going out with friends,
eating, concerts&hellip;</p>
