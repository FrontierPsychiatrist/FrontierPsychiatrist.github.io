<h1>music</h1>
<p>
I have been making music for a very long time now. Back then it was only the recorder. But I quickly progressed to the clarinet and kept playing that for almost 18 years. From 2005 - 2010 I was part of the <a href="http://www.jugend-musik-ensemble.de">Jugend Musik Ensemble</a> in Frankfurt, a really great small amateur orchestra. In Berlin, after a year of doing almost nothing musically I started to play piano, teaching myself.

You can find some piano recordings on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/moritz-schulze">my soundcloud page</a>.

Of course I also listen to music a lot. My taste varies, depending on the year, mood, daytime... Here's my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Ludwig_van">last.fm profile</a>

<p>I attend quite a lot concerts in Berlin - both classical and popular music.<p>
