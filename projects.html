<h1>my projects</h1>
<p>
    This page lists some basic information on my side projects. There aren't that much but maybe you'll find something useful.
</p>

<p>
I don't remember when I wrote my first program, but I'm pretty sure it was in Quick Basic. Throughout the years I was always interested in programming and how to tell the computer what to do. My mathematical education proved to be helpful in quickly grasping new concpets and languages.
</p>

<p>
In my job I mainly program in Java and Javascript. But I love to keep in touch with new stuff.

<p>
node-spotify is a wrapper around libspotify, a C library for Spotify services. I started it somewhere around december 2012 I think and it has gone a long way since.
</p>

<p>
Initially it was a project to play music from Spotify on my Raspberry Pi. But it soon became clear that it was too much to care for the library, some kind of backend and a frontend. So I chose to first "finish" (i.e. version 1.0.0) the library and then continue with my other ideas.

<p>
This is a project I started after I had to use Spring Security OAuth and found the documentation and example projects lacking.
